"""Address a particular question that arises from the data"""

# I chose to put all of the "address" code in the python notebook, 
# since I think it tells illustrates my thought process better
# and there isnt that much code to it. Also I feel like it isnt
# very reusable code, so it doesn't make much sense to put in 
# a library.

# The code that belongs here is all the model training and 
# design matrix generation functions.
